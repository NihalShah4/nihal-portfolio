# Building a Fraud Rule Explorer (From Dataset to Dashboard)

This post explains the end-to-end approach behind my Bank Fraud Rule Explorer project.

## What I wanted to solve
Fraud rules become hard to manage when:
- rule definitions are scattered
- thresholds are not calibrated
- analysts cannot quickly validate impact

## What I built
- A rule library with consistent schemas
- A scoring approach to compare rules
- A dashboard view for fast exploration

## What I learned
- Rule explainability matters as much as accuracy
- Clean metadata makes dashboards scalable
- Good defaults reduce analyst effort
